# Audio-Frequency-Sampler-for-Video-Effects
A tool that samples a .wav audio file and applies a Fast Fourier Transform to get the frequencies in the sample for syncing video-color effects to frequency/amplitude.  I've included a lot of adjustments and filtering options to fine tune the output for the desired effect. 

Output types included are 1: Graph output of frequencies in real time with playback of the audio file with a cursor index system to specify range(s) of the desired frequencies you want included to fine tune the output, 2: Color scale output preview window that adjusts hue based on frequencies and their magnitudes combined as a weighted average, 3: PNG output frames of the color scale for using with editing software. The code is somewhat hacked together because it's for personal use but I thought it might be interesting to share.
